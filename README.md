misc music tracking stuff (OPL2 and adlib related)

The python script takes the text-encoded data from the instrument maker software, decodes it and output all instruments in a readable format.
See the output.txt file, you'll get the instrument parameters if you want to play with OPL2 instruments.

This script is now a bit useless as I discovered Opl3BankEditor
https://github.com/Wohlstand/OPL3BankEditor

it does the same, but is bundled with many OPL banks so you will have many instruments to play with !
